  <strong>
    I use the strong tag! How am i different from bold?? Well, its useful when reader is a blind person
    and needs to listen from a text to speech machine.
    The machine can inform the blind person that this entire text is very important!

  <em>This text is emphasized, now how am I different from italic?? em tag is very similar to italic tag but the difference again
    is the importance of the text, similar to the meaning of a strong tag
